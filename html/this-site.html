                        I had a little Raspberri Pi 3 sitting around for years because I couldn't find a use for it. It was cool to have a second computer running linux but it wasn't <i>useful.</i> So instead of having it collect dust on my desk, I put
                        it to work. I installed apache 2, bought this domain for $0.89, and coded this site manually because I can and I felt like it.

                        I poked around on hostinger to find a domain that fit my brand and settled on jamfactory.tech. After this, I set up port triggering on my home router, set up the apache port, and added nameservers to match my public IP on hostinger.</br>
                        Then I got to work making my site. Nothing fancy, just me, VS Code, and github.
